# Module 22 Mini-Project: Hotel Reservation System

In this mini-project, you will build a Python program that represents a hotel reservation system and runs from the command line. Users will be able to search for available rooms, make reservations, and cancel reservations.

## User Stories

* It's done when each room listing includes details such as room number, type, price per night, and amenities.

* It's done when the hotel clerk can reserve a room by providing the room number.

* It's done when the system updates the room‚Äôs availability status to reflect that it is no longer available.

* It's done when the clerk receives a confirmation message indicating that the room has been successfully reserved.
